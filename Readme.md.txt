# ⚖️ Balance of Elements

**Balance of Elements** is a 2D physics-based puzzle game built using **Godot Engine 3.5**, developed for the **Gamedev.js Jam 2025**.  
Your goal is to balance the scale using objects with different weights, solving increasingly challenging levels with clever logic and precision.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Drag and drop items onto both sides of the scale.
- The first 4 levels require you to perfectly balance both sides.
- Later levels ask you to **reach a specific target weight** using limited items.
- Some levels introduce **bombs** with countdowns and other surprises!

The game challenges both your intuition and your logic skills.
